## About

orbitSim2D simulates N-body interactions of user defined celestial bodies and space vessels (in 2D). There are no limits on how many bodies or vessels you can create
or how you set the balance between simulation speed or precision.

There is also an additional three-body-problem generator, which creates random triple star systems for rapid creation and observation of such systems.

## Requirements
